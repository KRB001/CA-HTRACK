Pitch 6/6
Solid Pitch for Finance Tracking. Kinda like Mint. 
Diagrams 28/32
Use Case - Solid set of six use cases, usually in a UML diagram, the actors are pretty simple (child, adult, business ower) but you included a few extra that are defined by their motivations. This is good user-centered design but perhaps a bit too much information for a use case diagram. 
Class - Solid
Sequences - Very detailed flow of information. Make sure to include a title so that it is obvious what this sequence is showing. For example, why is the account constructor being called between the Writer and Analytics classes?  Also, I was looking for two different sequence diagrams for two different use cases. It is unclear from the diagram whether this is one long sequence or a few smaller sequences. 
State - Good flow for the user interface.

Wel commented with Javadocs
Comprehensive Tests for multiple classes.
AccountTest is technically an integration test because it calls different methods for the account class but a more comprehensive integration test might use the interactions across objects representing multiple classes. 
Good Work 55/60
