# CA$HTRACK

A compact command-line finance application.
Designed in one week for D. Turnbull's COMP 34500

Pitch for project can be found here:

Use case chosen was that of the salaried worker as shown in my use-case diagram.
For this case, most methods involving tracking and budgeting were implemented, i.e. most features except the analytics and recommendation system.
An integration test can be found in the AccountTest.java test file (this does not exist in earlier test commits due to the fact that it is heavily dependent on other classes being fully implemented)
